Exchange and DeFi dApp 

Simple ERCO20 Token Exchange.

Written in JS, React and Solidity for Ethereum 
Smart contracts.

Smart contracts mints FDM tokens and allows
users to swap them with Ether using Web3 and 
MetaMask.

I deployed this to a locally hosted blockchain
using gnache.

I have also deployed contracts to Rinkeby and 
Robsten testnets.
