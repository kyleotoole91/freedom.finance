Exchange and DeFi dApp 

Simple ERCO20 Token Exchange.

Written in JavaScript, React and Solidity.

Deploys Ethereum Smart contracts and contains a Web3/React interface.
Smart contracts mint the FDM tokens and allow users to swap them for Ether using Web3 and MetaMask.

These contracts were deployed to a locally hosted blockchain using Gnache.
I have also deployed and tested the contracts on the Rinkeby and Robsten testnets.
