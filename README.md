Exchange and DeFi dApp 

Simple ERCO20 Token Exchange.

Written in JS, React and Solidity for Ethereum 
Smart contracts.

Smart contracts mint the FDM tokens and allows
users to swap them for Ether using Web3 and 
MetaMask.

These contracts were deployed to a locally hosted blockchain
using Gnache.

I have also deployed the contracts to Rinkeby and 
Robsten testnets.
